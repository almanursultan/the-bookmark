# ðŸ“š The BookBark

The BookBark is a web application that allows users to search for books, view book details, and join book clubs to discuss their favorite books with like-minded readers. Unlike traditional book clubs where users must read pre-selected books, this platform enables users to join clubs based on the books they are already reading.

ðŸ“– **Problem:**  
Book lovers often struggle to find communities discussing the books they are currently reading. Many book clubs follow predefined reading lists, which may not always align with individual interests.  
âœ¨ **Solution:**  
The BookBark provides a solution by allowing users to join discussions based on books they choose to read.
